# Quiz


The goal of this was to create a quiz which 
had a timer that counted down to 0
had the quiz end when the timer got to 0
had the quiz end when all the questions were answered
told the user if they answered the question correctly or incorrectly
applied a penalty to the time if they clicked the wrong answer
and gave the total score at the end.

While the current quiz is not very aesthetically pleasing, it does do those things.

It was also expected that
the user could type in their initals at the end
the intitals along side the score would appea on a high score list
these values would be saved to the local storage.

This only partially works. I ran into trouble getting all of this to run correctly, but my code has some comments describing what I believe should happen
